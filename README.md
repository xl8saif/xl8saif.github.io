## Setup Instructions

### 1. Place Your Portrait

Copy your professional portrait to:

```
public/images/saif-ullah.jpg
```

**Important:** Do not rename the file. The HTML references this exact path.

### 2. Configure the Contact Form (Formspree)

The hiring form uses **Formspree** for form submission on static hosting.

**Why Formspree?**
- Works with GitHub Pages (static hosting)
- Handles file attachments
- Provides spam protection
- Sends email notifications
- No backend server required

**Setup Steps:**

1. Go to https://formspree.io/register and create a free account.
2. Create a new form.
3. Copy your form endpoint URL (looks like `https://formspree.io/f/xxxxxxxx`).
4. Open `index.html` and find this line in the form:
   ```html
   <form class="hire-form" id="hire-form" action="https://formspree.io/f/YOUR_FORM_ID" method="POST" ...>
   ```
5. Replace `YOUR_FORM_ID` with your actual Formspree form ID.
6. Commit and push to GitHub.

**Formspree Free Plan Limits:**
- 50 submissions per month
- File attachments up to 10MB
- Basic spam protection

**Alternative Services:**
If you prefer not to use Formspree, you can also use:
- **Getform** (https://getform.io)
- **FormSubmit** (https://formsubmit.co)
- ** Basin** (https://usebasin.com)

Simply replace the `action` URL in the form tag with your chosen service endpoint.

### 3. Deploy to GitHub Pages

1. Push all files to your repository (`xl8saif.github.io`).
2. Go to repository **Settings → Pages**.
3. Select source: **Deploy from a branch** → **main** → **/(root)**.
4. Wait 1–2 minutes for deployment.
5. Visit https://xl8saif.github.io/
